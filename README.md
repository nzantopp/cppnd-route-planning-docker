# cppnd-route-planning-docker

## Introduction

This repository contains the Docker build file facilitates the first project "Build an OpenStreetMap Route Planner" of the Udacity C++ Nanodegree.

## Quick Start

Pull and run the image with:
```bash
docker pull nzantopp/cppnd-route-planning:latest
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on the host machine.
- For GUI applications, platform-specific configurations are needed (as detailed below).

## Displaying GUI from the Container

The project's application, `OSM_A_star_search`, requires graphical display capabilities. 

### Linux:
1. Allow your X11 server to accept connections:
    ```
    xhost +
    ```

2. Start the Docker container with X11 socket sharing:
    ```
    docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro nzantopp/cppnd-route-planning:latest
    ```

### macOS:
1. Install and set up XQuartz:
    - Download from [XQuartz's official site](https://www.xquartz.org/) or use Homebrew:
        ```
        brew install --cask xquartz
        ```
    - Launch XQuartz and enable "Allow connections from network clients" in **Preferences** â†’ **Security**.
      ```
      xquartz
      ```

2. Permit connections and get the IP:
    ```
    xhost +
    IP=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
    ```

3. Start the Docker container with the DISPLAY variable:
    ```
    docker run -e DISPLAY=$IP:0 nzantopp/cppnd-route-planning:latest
    ```

## Configuration

Default configurations are set for typical use. To override configurations or provide additional settings, please refer to the application's documentation.

## Networking
